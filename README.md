An integrated system to detect and respond to a live-threatening allergic reaction. 
Monitors three indicators of anaphylactic shock:
  - Histamine levels in the blood
  - Blood pressure
  - Core body temperature
 
Histamine:
  Normal histamine levels in a non-allergic person are around 0.9 nmol/L. Histamine levels of 6.35 nmol/L or higher 
  are indicative of a life-threatening allergic reaction.
Blood pressure:
  A blood pressure drop of 30% or more from a person's baseline due to vasodilation can indicate an allergic reaction.
Core body temperature:
  Core body temperature drops during an allergic reaction, by between 5.6 and 6.8 degrees celsius.
